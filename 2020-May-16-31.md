# Practicalli Project Update 1
Unfortunately I was ill for most of this period, so not as much achieved this time.  I am (and always intended to) extending the work passed the Clojurists Together sponsor period.

## Summary
Continuing the weekly broadcasts on Clojure spec, a topic that will be added to the Practicalli Clojure book.

Added GitHub issues / PR shields for each book on the website to make tracking and contributing more convenient.

Pages on how to use Magit forge to list and create issues and pull requests as well as fork repositories on GitHib, all from within Spacemacs (Emacs).


## Practicalli Website
Added [Shields](https://github.com/badges/shields) for each book with links to content ideas and pull requests on the respective repositories.  Aids in the tracking of book progress and providing another way for others to contribute.

Added YouTube playlists to the Practicalli website to make specific video content easier to find.

Updated the Creative commons license notice on the front pages of all books and GitHub README files, ensuring compliance with the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).

Add favicon to each book website


## Practicalli Study Group
Continuing the new series on `clojure.spec.alpha`, this time comparing function definition validation with `:pre` / `:post` conditions and spec `fdef`.
