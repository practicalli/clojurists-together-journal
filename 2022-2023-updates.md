## New Book: Engineering Playbook

Specific guides (plays) to common software engineering tasks covering a range of practices and tools

* Architecture
  - [C4 code driven architecture diagrams and Structurizr tool](https://practical.li/engineering-playbook/architecture/structurizr/)
  - Practicalli FinTech risk system with Data Science Modelling example architecture
* Build tools
  - [Make universal build automation tool](https://practical.li/engineering-playbook/build-tool/make/)
* Code Quality
  - MegaLinter local runner and GitHub Workflow - providing a wide range of lint tools for code and configuration files
  - Clojure quality tools - format, syntax and idiom checks (clj-kondo, cljstye, cljfmt, zprint)
* Command Line tools
  - [kitty terminal](https://practical.li/engineering-playbook/command-line/kitty-terminal/) - fast and feature rich GPU based terminal emulator
* Continuous Integration
  - Common GitHub actions
  - [Example GitHub workflows](https://practical.li/engineering-playbook/continuous-integration/github-workflow/) used in production


## Practicalli Clojure Web Services
- [Service REPL Workfow](https://practical.li/clojure-web-services/service-repl-workflow/) added, including
  - Aero parsing of system configuration and tag literals
  - Integrant REPL for a repl reloaded workflow when building clojure services
  - Integrant to manage system components at Clojure Service runtime
- [GitHub template for a Clojure project](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-service-template/) including tools.build, format tools configuration, Makefile task automation, Dockerfile and REPL reloaded user namespace

## New Book: Practicall VSpaceCode

Started a guide to using VSpaceCode for clojure development, bringing VS Code, Calva and vim-style editing together as an effective tool.

Key bindings for Calva were submitted and merged to VSpaceCode

Additional settings and key bindings were created to enhance the experience.
