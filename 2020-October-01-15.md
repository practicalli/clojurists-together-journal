# Clojurists Together Q3 - Practicalli - Update 4

Creating more [recorded video content around REPL driven development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpr9V-R8ZxiB3u90ga_SdxYsF2k2JTag1) of high quality, improving speed of editing with Blender.org as well as better script writing and delivery practice.

Represented Clojure at the JVMWars 2020 online meetup, giving [a short presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR3jDNOaYoAQRUQcCm9NccXY-dNxr5JT5LfURqujAVp23dohoYKLH9BHGlFgdQjKrLKnNKkraeRbKzA/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) which included [a brief demo of REPL driven development](https://youtu.be/rQ802kSaip4).


## Practicalli Study Group
Refactored the data-access code into `practicalli.data.*` namespaces to make each namespace have a specific aim. Identified generic functions to reduce repetition in the code.

Added unit test fixture (setup/teardown) to create and delete the H2 database on the fly, using functions in the `handler-helper` namespace.

* [086 - Banking On Clojure - Part7 - Refactor data-access namespaces and fix the build on CircleCI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro_h5jt02Q0&list=PLpr9V-R8ZxiDjyU7cQYWOEFBDR1t7t0wv&index=89)


## Practicalli Clojure
New sections and Pages:
* [Unit testing selectors](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/testing/unit-testing/test-selectors.html)
* [Unit testing fixtures](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/testing/unit-testing/fixtures.html)

New page on the use of test selectors to organise tests and run test suites more effectively.  Included examples for LambdaIsland kaocha, Spacemacs, Cider and Cognitect labs test runners.

New page on fixtures for unit tests, with example fixture functions and configuration on when to run fixtures for testing.

## Screencasts
* [Clojure REPL driven development with Rebel Readline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19TWMsg0s0&list=PLpr9V-R8ZxiB3u90ga_SdxYsF2k2JTag1&index=1)
* [Clojure projects with the REPL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7muHVkxzZcE&list=PLpr9V-R8ZxiB3u90ga_SdxYsF2k2JTag1&index=2)
* [Cloure REPL driven development - a simple example](https://youtu.be/rQ802kSaip4)

Updated [Cognitect REBL install procedure](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/alternative-tools/clojure-tools/cognitect-rebl.html), local maven install no longer required.

Updated [Conjure configuration](https://gist.github.com/jr0cket/6c475137ee57fbb14f9289bd76889512) and documentation


## Screencast Video Editing
Learned how to [use Blender.org for Video editing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxdnSsBqCrrG9vYaQMDE0A16c4M52b7vJ) which proved to be much more efficient that previous tools used.  This will help produce a higher quality of videos for the new series on Clojure CLI tools and REPL driven development.


## Practicalli Clojure deps.edn configuration
Minor updates to the practicalli/clojure-deps-edn user level configuration for Clojure CLI tools.  This configuration is alsor recommeded by [seancorfield/dot-clojure](https://github.com/seancorfield/dot-clojure) personal configuration

* inspect/rebl - link added to updated install requirements
* updated library versions for: clj-new and depstar update
* title and alias sub-section in mini table of contents
* merge project related aliases into one section


## Practicalli Spacemacs
Changes to the [practicalli/spacemacs.d](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs.d/) configuration for Spacemacs.
* renamed Git branch to [live](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs.d/) (update your remote urls)
* recommending Emacs 27.1 as its the current stable version and it supports ligatures (stylized character pairs).
* added unicode ligature support (no need for ligature configuration in dotspacemacs/user-config as it built into the unicode layer)
* Switched to using Fira code font as this has ligature support
* Updated the doom modeline theme for a  nice minimal look without loosing any important information
* Added font rendering optimizations

Several custom snippets added to the [practicalli/spacemacs.d](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs.d/): deprecated and design journal banners, rich code block with clj-kondo ignore duplicate
