# Practicalli Project Update 6
Started series called Banking on Clojure to cover application servers, sql and relational databases.  This will cover the full development and deployment workflow, including clojure.spec for specifications and generative testing.

Added more tools to practicalli/clojure-deps-edn

Add anchors to all sub-headings across all books, making content easier to navigate by enabling navigation to specific sections in a page.  This helps keep relevant information together on one page and reference a specific section from other pages.


## Practicalli Clojure WebApp
Started a section on [Application servers](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure-webapps/app-servers/), covering approaches to server configuration and server start/stop/reload.

Started a section on Databases that will initially cover H2 and Postgresql relational databases, using Sql with next.jdbc

Created Banking on Clojure WebApp content for the live broadcasts and book.  The project uses CircleCI for continuous integration and Heroku pipelines for deployment to staging and production.


## Practicalli Clojure
Configure REPL startup using `dev/user.clj` file and `:dev` alias in practicalli/clojure-deps-edn configuration.  Added examples of [requiring namespaces and starting component lifecycle services at REPL starup](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-tools/configure-repl-startup.html) added to Practicalli Clojure book.

Add section on [data browser tools](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-tools/data-browsers/), extending REBL and Clojure Inspector with new projects Reveal and Portal.


## practicalli/clojure-deps-edn
Identified main purpose of the practicalli/clojure-deps-edn project, to provide a large set of meaningful and consistently named aliases that would be available in all projects and less likely to be over-ridden by project specific deps.edn configuration.

Any experimental or alpha state tools are clearly marked as 'experimental - used at own risk' to set clear expectations.

Updated libraries used in aliases are using their fully qualified names, e.g. cider/cider-nrepl as this will be required for future versions of the Clojure CLI tool.

Added Google Storage mirrors for Maven Central for Americas, Asia and Europe to library repository configuration.  Also added a community mirror in Asia (China) for Clojars.

Recent alias additions include
- `:dev` - include the `/dev/ path to configure REPL startup with a /dev/user.clj file
- `rebel-nrepl` - run rebel REPL with nrepl connection for editor connections (eg. CIDER, Calva)
- `:nrebl` - REBL data browser on nREPL connection (e.g. CIDER, Calva)
- `:deploy-locally` to add a jar to _/.m2 directory
- `:deploy-clojars` to deploy a jar on clojars.org
- `:deploy-clojars-signed` to sign and deploy a jar on clojars.org
- `:carve` - a new project to carve out unused vars in code
- `:repl-reveal` - a REPL with data browser


## Practicalli Spacemacs
Add Emacs profiler use to the [Spacemacs troubleshooting guide](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/install-spacemacs/troubleshooting.html)
