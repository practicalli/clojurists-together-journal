# Clojurists Together Q3 - Practicalli - Update 5
A range of updates, new content and tool reviews and testing.  [Helping lots of students on Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/Practicalli) in the last week.

## Practicalli Study Group
Getting back to some important basics of Clojure, walking through several Exercism.io coding challenges (to support mentoring efforts there).

* [089 - Code challenges - Regular Expressions to solve Bob challenge on Exercism.io](https://youtu.be/QKBZYSITkRc)
* [088 - Code challenges - Encoding and decoding](https://youtu.be/91wrchRjdtg)
* [087 - Clojure CLI tools - Practicalli Clojure deps.edn configuration and a tour of community tools](https://youtu.be/u5VoFpsntXc)

## Practicalli Clojure
Reviewed the Introduction and Getting Started sections, improving the flow and providing a solid introduction to Clojure.

New sections
* [Using Clojure CLI tools - common tasks](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-tools/using-clojure-tools.html) - with accompanying broadcast
* [Community Tools](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-tools/install/community-tools.html) providing a detailed guide to tools built on Clojure CLI.
* [Code Analysis](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-tools/install/code-analysis.html) - install and configuring clj-kondo
* [Neovim and Conjure install guide](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-editors/editor-install-guides/neovim-conjure.html)
* [Neovim and Conjure user guide](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-editors/editor-user-guides/neovim-conjure.html)

Updated [Clojure CLI tools version used with CircleCI](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/testing/integration-testing/circle-ci/) and updating scripts to use -M flag with aliases.

Evaluated [Spacevim](https://spacevim.org/) to see if it should be added to the [recommended Clojure aware editors](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-editors/).  An issue was found running the Clojure CLI tools REPL on Linux, along with a quick fix.  Although the configuration of vim packages is excellent and a very impressive overall experience. the Clojure environment is very basic and would welcome modernizing.  Ideally adding [Conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure) to SpaceVim would produce an excellent development experience.


## Practicalli clojure-deps-edn
Updates and fixes to the user level configuration for Clojure CLI projects

* Add `:middleware/cider-clj` and `:middleware/cider-clj-refactor` aliases to allow connections to a running REPL from Cider (and should also work for Calva).
* practicalli/live middleware/clojure-clj-refactor: add documentation
* Clojure CLI config precedence - added graphic
* Added Common development tasks
* kaocha test runner: fix for 1.0.700 release
* Update group-id of `deps-deploy` (#3)


## Practicalli Spacemacs
New content:
* [Running specific test groups with test selectors](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/testing/unit-testing/running-tests.html#using-test-selectors-to-run-specific-tests)

Updated content:
* [Line numbers - visual, relative and absolute styles](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/install-spacemacs/line-numbers.html)
* [Repeating searches and scrolling through search pattern history](https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/spacemacs-basics/working-with-projects/searching-projects.html)

### Cider issue
Investigated bug with Emacs Cider and the new Clojure CLI tools `-M` alias flag.  Cider modeled Clojure CLI tools support on the approach for Leinigen and this resulted in the -A alias flag occurring out of position.  The clojure command does work this way, only since the `-M` flag has been introduced that the issue became visible.  The fix organises the arguments in the correct position
* [Issue: Clojure CLI command parameters order incorrect](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/2916)
* [PR: jack-in: move Clojure-cli parameter global-opts after -Sdeps](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/2917)

[Hacking on CIDER live broadcast](https://youtu.be/XuquYgOSOnc) to evolve the way cider-jack-in manages aliases. Covers basic elisp print line style debugging and how to hack on the live Cider code running in Emacs.

## Clojure CLI support for other tools
Reviewed Clojure CLI support for other [Clojure aware editors](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/clojure-editors/) recommended and raised issues and fixes.

### Calva issue
Calva only seems to allow the use of `-A` flag when using its jack-in feature, so [issue #826 raised](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/issues/826) for awareness of the change in Clojure CLI tools.

### Spacevim issue
Spacevim [fails to run the REPL using Command Line tools on Unix systems](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues/3931), picking up the wrong executable name.  Suggested [a quick hack to fix the issue](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/issues/3931#issuecomment-720140933) to help the community create a suitable fix in vimscript.
